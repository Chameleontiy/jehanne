# Jehanne

Jehanne is a [simple][simplicity] operating system. 

It is a fork of [Harvey][harvey] (which in turn is a fork of 
[Plan 9 from Bell Labs][plan9] merged with [Nix][nix] sources) but
diverges from the design and conventions of its ancestors whenever
they are at odds with its goals.

For this reason project is named after the famous Franch heretic [Joan of Arc][arc].
